# Components
Components are ready-made interface elements that can be used in different patterns and layouts. They are part of our visual language and are intended to be used unchanged for a consistent user experience.

These components extend those used across Government in the GOV.UK design system. As our components mature, we will look to contribute them to the GOV.UK system so they can be used more widely.
